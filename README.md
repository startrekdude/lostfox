# lostfox

A pretty simple text adventure I made as an assignment for a class some time ago. It's not particularly good, but I'm nevertheless rather fond of it. The story is...surprisingly deep. I won't say more to avoid spoiling it. <!--Best used as a tool to understand my psyche.-->

Welcome to Lost Fox.
In this exciting tale of trials and tribulations, you, a lost fox, will find your way back to your
family across a harsh and unforgiving world.

Much like in real life, there is no save file.

You'll interact with the world by typing short commands like "go forward" or "talk to lizard".
You can use "look" or "gaze" to get more details about where you currently are.
To see all of the actions available to you, type "actions".

Good luck!
Name the lost fox: 
```

## Installation & running

It's just a simple Python program with no dependencies beyond the standard library. To run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/startrekdude/lostfox # only need to do this once
cd lostfox
python3 run.py
```

If you'd like it to be packaged more formally, I'd welcome a pull request to that end.
