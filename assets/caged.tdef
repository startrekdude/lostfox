=caged.msg_escape
$(name): You should slither out of your cage and open mine from the outside.
Crowley: Much obliged, kit!

Crowley slithers through the bars of his cage. It's a tight squeeze.
He slithers over to your cage and undoes the locking mechanism from the outside.

You're free, but still in the proverbial belly of the beast...

$(name): Thank you!
Crowley: Anything for a fox that just wants to see its family...
Crowley: Let's escape together.
