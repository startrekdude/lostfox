Welcome to Lost Fox.
In this exciting tale of trials and tribulations, you, a lost fox, will find your way back to your
family across a harsh and unforgiving world.

Much like in real life, there is no save file.

You'll interact with the world by typing short commands like "go forward" or "talk to lizard".
You can use "look" or "gaze" to get more details about where you currently are.
To see all of the actions available to you, type "actions".

Good luck!
